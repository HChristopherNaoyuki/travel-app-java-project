# Travel Log Application

## Overview
The Travel Log Application is a Java-based GUI application that allows users to log their travel plans by selecting a start location, an end location, and a method of travel. The app stores travel entries in a text file and displays the travel log within the application.

## Features
- User-friendly interface with dropdown selections for locations and travel methods.
- Input validation to ensure start and end locations are not the same.
- Persistent storage of travel logs in a text file.
- Dynamic display of travel logs within the application.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for running the application.

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Ensure you have the necessary libraries (Swing) included in your project.

### Running the Application
1. Compile the `TravelApp` class.
2. Run the `main` method in the `TravelApp` class.
